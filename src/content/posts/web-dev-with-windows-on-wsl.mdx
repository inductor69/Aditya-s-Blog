If someone told me a decade ago that we would be running the Linux kernel inside a regular Windows build, I would probably laugh at them. 

It's not new to anyone that the Microsoft has been aggressively adopting open-source tools and actively helping them grow for some time now. 

In the last few years, we saw the open-sourcing of PowerShell and Visual Studio Code, Edge's transition to Chromium, and even a partnership with Canonical to bring Ubuntu to Linux. From that partnership we saw the rise of the first version of the Windows Subsystem for Linux.

It was a huge move, and brought some quality of life improvements to web developers using Windows for development tasks. But it wasn't quite there yet...

<InformationSidenote>

  <p>The first version of WSL worked as an operation layer that would emulate the Linux API. It worked, but since Microsoft had to implement each API by hand, it was easy to get bonked each time Linux shifted some obscure things on the background. That would break things... Important things...</p>  

  <p className='last-line'>In the end, as much as it worked most of the time, there was always a chance of breaking some key component of the whole ecosystem, making it unreliable.</p>

# How does WSL 2 differs from the first version

The new version of the Linux Subsystem is a complete rework of the underlining architecture when compared to how the first version of WSL used to work:

  alt="A diagram of the underlining architecture of WSL2, showing how the Linux kernel communicates with Windows kernel via Hypervisor."
/>

Instead of trying to emulate system calls, the entire Linux kernel is now integrated **inside** Windows. That makes for a very seamlessly and native Linux development environment on top of Windows. 

Because of the new way this revamped architecture deals with I/O intensive operations, things like `git clone`, `npm install`, and `apt update` will be comparatively faster then they where when running under the last version.

# Virtualization on steroids

Now, it is important to understand that, behind the scenes, the new WSL is actually a Hyper-V virtual machine... Don't roll your eyes yet.

I don't hold much love for virtualization myself, and yet, even I was impressed when I got it running for the first time. Unlike traditional virtualized environments, this is so tightly integrated into the OS that it does not feel like a virtual machine in almost any aspect.

And it goes further. Want to thinker with the file system or spin a project under a new set of configurations? Spin a new instance, mess with it, throw it away, and spin yet another instance in a matter of minutes, switching arround distributions and both versions of WSL as you see fit.

This entire gimmick makes me think about all the development workflows that can be put in action with this, treating different Linux instances almost as if they were Docker containers, shutting down and bringing up instances of an entire development ecosystem in a matter of seconds.

The reason for me wanting to highlight that WSL 2 is essentially a virtual machine is so I can point to the fact that you will most likely not get a native performance out of it (altough it is surprisingly close), and it will be taxing on your hardware if you're running on a lower-end machine vs. running a light-weight Linux distribution by itself for example.

# Getting onboard

If what you saw so far got you inclined on going ahead, there are some WSL2 requirements you must meet:

- You must be using a *Windows 10 Pro* or *Enterprise* version (Home and Educational versions are supported on Windows Insider build as far as I know, but they introduce some unexpected gimmicks that you probably don't want to deal with).
- You need to be at least on the build 19041 from the 2004 - May Update.
- Your machine *must support Hyper-V*.

You can check for your build version by typing "About your PC" on the search bar. Under Windows Specifications, you can check the version, update and build you're currently running.

The Hyper-V support can be generally checked on your motherboard BIOS configurations.

# Installing WSL2

First step is to enable the optional system resource. You can search for "Turn Windows Feature on or off" and look for the checkboxes with "Windows Subsystem for Linux" and "Virtual Machine Platform". Check them both, let them download and reboot the machine.

  alt="Make sure to check the items 'Virtual Machine Platform' and 'Windows Subsystem for Linux'"

/>

With that done, open PowerShell, and set your WSL default version:

```
wsl --set-default-version 2
```

There is a chance that some step of this process asks for an update to the kernel component, depending on the version of Windows you're running. If it does, [download the .msi](https://aka.ms/wsl2kernel) file from Microsoft, install it, and execute the command again. 

If these steps are completed successfully, you can now go to the Microsoft Store and search for a Linux distribution of your choice. This choice will not make much of a difference in the context of regular WSL use, since you're not leveraging the graphical user interface from them (although you have the option to run Linux GUI applications, but that's out of this article's scope).

  alt="You can search the store for any Linux distribution of your liking"

To open the newly installed distribution, you can find the distro icon that was added to your list of programs, or just type `wsl` on cmd/Powershell. The first time you open the distribution it will take some time unpacking and setting up. As it finishes, you will be asked for a Unix user and password. This is the user and password you will be using on your Linux environment.

You can now see a list of installed distributions by running:

```
wsl --list
```

And set a version to a given distribution with: 

```
wsl --set-version <distribution name> <versionNumber>
```

And yes, you can run instances of multiple Linux distributions, and set them to use a different version of WSL.

# Settings and optimizing performance

WSL has some gimicks to performance optimization and . They nail down to excessive memory use and differences from the networking .

<WarningSidenote>

  <p>Later Windows updates will be correcting most of these problems, but I think it's important to bring them up as I cannot accurately pinpoint in which updates each of these fixes will be introduced, and what build the reader is currently using at any given time this article is read.</p>

  <p className='last-line'>I advise you to use and tinker with your system first, and then apply the necessary fixes if they seem to be happening in your system.</p>

## Keep memory usage in check

This is the most annoying, and to be honest, the most stupid one you will probably come across. Memory usage in WSL 2 can go wild if left unchecked. This happens because, by default, WSL 2 snags 80% of the available host system's memory, but doesn't do a very good job of returning that memory when processes are no longer using it. The first step to keep that in check is creating a `.wslconfig` file insider your user folder on Windows, usually `C:\Users\user_name`:

```
[wsl2]
memory=3GB
```

Remember to restart WSL for the changes to take effect on your next WSL startup. This will limit the amount of memory it consumes, so you can adjust according to your system specs.

If still, you don't want your total set amount of memory to be consumed all the time, you can create a bash alias to free that memory on the go:

```bash
alias drop_cache="sudo sh -c \"echo 3 >'/proc/sys/vm/drop_caches' && swapoff -a && swapon -a && printf '\n%s\n' 'Ram-cache and Swap Cleared'\""
```

## Localhost and networking

Since WSL 2 is actually a virtualized environment, differently from WSL 1 where the networking used the same IP adress as the host system's IP, WSL 2 NAT's it's virtual network instead of making it bridged to the host OS's NIC.

In early days of WSL 2 this used to be a problem. But as far as I've tested outside of Windows Insider Previews, this has been already adressed, as WSL automatically bridges localhost apps from the virtual machine to the host OS and no further configuration is needed.

If you're in need of running your development server under the native machine's IP adress, there is a common workround that consists in forwarding the TCP ports of WSL 2 services to the host OS. You can see it in details in [this Github issue comment](https://github.com/microsoft/WSL/issues/4150#issuecomment-504209723). Keep in mind that it uses `ifconfig` to `grep` WSL's IP adress, so you may need to run `sudo apt-get install net-tools` on your WSL distribution as it no longer comes as the default networking tool in some of the popular distros. 

If you wish to have a deeper understanding about how the networking layer works in WSL 2 so you can make your own changes and implementations, I highly recommend watching [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCK3easuYm4) from David Bombal, where he explains it in-depth.

# Keep using WSL 1 if...

After dedicating an entire section to WSL 2 problems and their hacky workrounds, I would be a hypocrite to say that it's all flowers and rainbows. It's far from that. And there are cases in which, if you still want to keep Windows as your development environment, WSL 1 will inevitably be a better fit.

Yes, WSL 2 improves I/O performance and has real kernel compatibility that could not be emulated by WSL's "kernel" implementation. But WSL 1 uses the same networking stack from Windows, cutting down on many of the VM's problems with networking and required bridging for development servers. Processes in WSL 1 use the exact amount of memory they need to use, as they are not running under a virtualized environment; processes go directly to the host OS. You can safely work on projects stored inside mounted drivers on WSL 1 without tanking I/O performance, as it is still using Windows system calls.

The basic rule of thumb here would be, if your environment was already working well on WSL 1, don't botter rushing in and upgrading to WSL 2 as it will probably give you some things to take care of regarding network and memory management. Remember, you can have multiple instances of different distributions, running under both versions of WSL. The instances you can create, depending on how you treat them, are very much disposable. And that is great! It means you can take the time to test what is going to work for you, and default to that instance as it proves to do so.

# Wrapping up

I'm excited to see what comes ahead in terms of Windows/Linux interoperability as WSL grows in size and scope on the development community awereness.

Ever since I started I've been a hostage of Linux as my primary development environment, and I was never really happy with the desktop environment provided by many of the popular distributions and Linux's own little peculiarities to performance and device management. Even after spending some time on macOS as my primary daily driver, it was not an OS I felt confortable calling home.

Having WSL become a mature technology means bringing my development experience back to Windows with almost zero compromisses. And I'm all down on that.
